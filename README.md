- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure functionality and security, I focused on writing thorough unit tests that verified expected behavior and caught potential bugs early. I also practiced defensive programming by validating inputs and managing errors carefully. Using test-driven development principles helped me identify vulnerabilities and logic issues before they could become larger problems.

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I interpret user needs by carefully reviewing requirements and thinking about how the end user will interact with the program. I prioritize usability, simplicity, and correctness. For example, when designing the Contact Service, I considered constraints like ensuring phone numbers and addresses met length requirements, and IDs were unique, reflecting real-world business rules.

- How do I approach designing software?

When designing software, I first plan out the structure by identifying key classes, responsibilities, and how they should interact. I focus on modular design to make the code easy to understand, test, and maintain. For both projects, I designed with future testing and expansion in mind, keeping methods small and focused on a single responsibility wherever possible.
